MultiFormPoster is a .NET 3.5 class library for creating form POSTs which are commonly used for accessing
web APIs. This is typically done with the WebClient Upload file method but that class doesn't give you the 
flexibility to add more name/value parameters to the form POST.

I've taken his example and blown it out a bit to add some functionality such as basic http auth functions.
